## 1. Project Details

This is a SAIT SD CPRG306-B assignment folder by [Louielyn Mata](https://github.com/louielynmata)

### 2. Description

This repo is for my **CPRG 306 – WEBDEV2, Week 2 Assignment**. It’s the starting point for all future assignments, built with a Next.js app named `cprg306-assignments`.

## 3. Getting Started

Installation Instructions

These instructions are from the default next.js README.md.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result or visit the [Deployed Live Website (Vercel)](https://cprg306-assignments-louielynmata.vercel.app/).

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
